Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************

Let's make our game even better! Our final goal is to be able to play against the computer.
So the first step along this path is to create a game controller.

Create a class called GameController. This class will have the primary concern of controlling 
the game. It will both start, end, and decide what needs to happen next. It will need 
the following methods

	public void start()

	private void end()
	
	private void doNext()

Remove any kind of UI functionality from the main method and put it inside the UserInteface class.
All that should be in the main method is new GameController().start();

If you feel classes or methods are missing add them!

Add the classes to package: com.israluci.ch05TicTacToe.ex02

Enjoy!

********************************************************************************************
The refactored program is much much better. The comments are very useful and the classes
make it easy to understand the architecture.

I like how you used the methods in the UserInterface class to clearly explain what is happening.

Note however I'd like you think a little bit more about inheritance. For example it's not a good
idea to hard code a characteristic of a class in it's name. Instead of having Piece, PieceO, PieceX
I would have used: Piece, TicTacToePiece. Then in Piece I would have added an abstract method
with a signature like this: abstract public String getShape();

More on this in next exercise.

Question:

It seems this is more of a design exercise. But I am still trying to dissect this paragraph:

Remove any kind of UI functionality from the main method and put it inside the UserInteface class.
All that should be in the main method is new GameController().start();

When you said main method, are you referring to StartGame class main method?
Also this is the first time I see new GameController().start(); If I break it down means creating an object
and then calling start method but it still throws me off.

Can you please explain or can you point me to seciton of the chapter I should be focusing on?
answer: you are right, this is more about design and learning the importance of objects in object oriented design. 
here's a tip. in your method call the start method, then have a 
while loop like this: while(controller.donext()){} then when loop exits call the end method.
