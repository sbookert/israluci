Difference 1:

There are only 6 comments in your code. Removing the comments from my program looks a lot cleaner and easy to read.

Difference 2:

Two more methods besides Main were created (getDatesFromInput, printOutput).

Difference 3:
Two private static variables, one of them is constant. The book also states that access to members of a class should be
set explicitly, most of the times private unless it is a public constant field.


Difference 4:

Your program is easy to read. Comments are minimal and other methods were created besides what was specified. 
Reviewing your program made me remember one of the goals of OOP is to easily find mistakes in our program. 
By creating other methods it can help readability and the ease of finding which method caused an issue.
