Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************



Write a program that produces the following command line prompt and operations:



Hello, insert some numbers separated by commas:
2,6,7,3,1

Thanks! 

Here is are your numbers in ascending order:
1,2,3,6,7

Here is are your numbers in descending order:
7,6,3,2,1



Put your solution in a package named com.israluci.ch03fundamentalstructures.ex02 and skype me 
the file or files when you are done.

This is a little bit harder than your last exercise, and it will get harder and harder. Good luck!



Feedback:
********************************************************************************************

First of all I really like your solution. However you need to find a different strategy for reading in the 
input so that it doesn't generate unexpected results.

Here is 1 output:
Hello, insert some numbers separated by commas:
2,3,5
Thanks!
Here is are your numbers in ascending order:
0,0,2,3,5,
Here is are your numbers in descending order:
5,3,2,0,0,

Here is another output:
Hello, insert some numbers separated by commas:
1,4,7,8,5,2,6
Thanks!
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
	at com.israluci.ch03fundamentalstructures.ex02.OrderNumbers.main(OrderNumbers.java:25)
	
Can you fix the program so you don't have extra zeros in the first program and you don't get an exception when entering 
more than 5 numbers? If you'd like me to give you a hint let me know.

Please name your new solution OrderNumbers02.java

HINT 1:
first read the input as one string, then break it up into pieces using the split method like this: "1,9,4".split(",");
then convert to int then do the sorting.
