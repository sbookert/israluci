Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************

Let's have some fun! We'll create a Tic Tac Toe game :) Let's start with the board and 
X and O pieces.

Create a class called Board. The class should have the following methods:

	public String render()
		- should return a string like this:
			[ ][ ][ ]
			[ ][ ][ ]
			[ ][ ][ ]
	public boolean addPiece(Piece p)
		- should return true if the piece can be placed on a square, then put the piece there
		- should return false if there is already a piece there or if the square doesn't exist
		- the top left square is has x=0, y=0, the bottom right square is x=2, y=2

Create a class called Piece, and two child classes called PieceX and PieceO the methods 
are up to you.
	
Create a class called UserInterface which has the following methods:

	public Piece askWhereToPutPiece()
		- this class should print to console: Where do you want to place your piece? (example: 'x on 1,0' or 'exit')
		- returns null if user typed exit
	
	public void showBoard()
		- this class prints the board to the screen for example: 
			[ ][X][ ]
			[ ][ ][O]
			[ ][ ][ ]

Create a class which has a main method called StartGame

if you feel classes or methods are missing add them!

Add the classes to package: com.israluci.ch05TicTacToe.ex01

Enjoy!

You did a very nice job!

I like that your code is cleaner and easy to understand and has the right amount of comments.
I like how you made row and column dynamic so you can have a larger board.

I would like to suggest that you try to keep concerns separate. This means that if you have 
a class called UserInterface you should put all user interactions inside there. So there 
shouldn't be any messages to the user in StartGame class. This text should have also been 
in the UI class: System.out.println("Y invalid location");

It's also common practice to keep fields like this private: int row=3,col=3,max=row*col;

I don't think this should be static: private static String p;

All in all well done!
