Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************

Object oriented programming is the key concept behind the Java programming language. In this
exercise you'll practice making classes.

Write a program that takes a list of dates and calculates how many days are between 
neighboring dates. Create a class called DateComparor which has a several methods. The class
should have methods with the signatures:

public int computeDaysBetweenDates(Date first, Date second);
public int computeMonthsBetweenDates(Date first, Date second);
public int computeYearsBetweenDates(Date first, Date second);
public static int getNumberOfCallsToCompute();

Use class DateComparor in your program to generate the following output:


Hello, insert 2 or more dates separated by commas:
01/06/1980,05/30/1989,12/30/1989

Thanks! 

There is/are the number of day(s) between date 01/06/1980 and 05/30/1989: 3432
There is/are the number of months(s) between date 01/06/1980 and 05/30/1989: 112
There is/are the number of year(s) between date 01/06/1980 and 05/30/1989: 9

There is/are the number of day(s) between date 05/30/1989 and 12/30/1989: 214
There is/are the number of months(s) between date 05/30/1989 and 12/30/1989: 7
There is/are the number of year(s) between date 05/30/1989 and 12/30/1989: 0

Bye!


Put your solution in a package named com.israluci.ch04objectsandclasses.ex01 and skype me 
only the .java file or files when you are done.
