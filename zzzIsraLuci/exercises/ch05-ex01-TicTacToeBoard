Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************

Let's have some fun! We'll create a Tic Tac Toe game :) Let's start with the board and 
X and O pieces.

Create a class called Board. The class should have the following methods:

	public String render()
		- should return a string like this:
			[ ][ ][ ]
			[ ][ ][ ]
			[ ][ ][ ]
	public boolean addPiece(Piece p)
		- should return true if the piece can be placed on a square, then put the piece there
		- should return false if there is already a piece there or if the square doesn't exist
		- the top left square is has x=0, y=0, the bottom right square is x=2, y=2

Create a class called Piece, and two child classes called PieceX and PieceO the methods 
are up to you.
	
Create a class called UserInterface which has the following methods:

	public Piece askWhereToPutPiece()
		- this class should print to console: Where do you want to place your piece? (example: 'x on 1,0' or 'exit')
		- returns null if user typed exit
	
	public void showBoard()
		- this class prints the board to the screen for example: 
			[ ][X][ ]
			[ ][ ][O]
			[ ][ ][ ]

Create a class which has a main method called StartGame

if you feel classes or methods are missing add them!

Add the classes to package: com.israluci.ch05TicTacToe.ex01

Enjoy!
