My Environment/Eclipse flow
To start working:
* Fetch
* Pull changes from upstream into current branch (master)
* Create branch from local master to start working

When finished:
* select/point to local master
* click branch
* right click branch
* select merge
* commit 
* push changes

Note: 
* when opening eclipse make sure there is a branch to work on.
* in case user forgot to create branch then we have to work, commit and push local master.
* in case we comitted work to master and there are no conflicts, just push local master.
