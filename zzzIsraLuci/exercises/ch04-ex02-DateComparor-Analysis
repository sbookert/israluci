Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************

Organizing code is an important art in software engineering. The code which you wrote in 
your previous example could have been even better when it organized a little more.
In this exercise you'll practice analyzing code so that you can organize your code 
better in the future.

Part 1. 
Compare your solution from com.israluci.ch04objectsandclasses.ex01.DateComparorTest.java with
my solution in com.israluci.ch04objectsandclasses.ex01.vlad.DateComparorTest.java

Write what the differences are in file:
com/israluci/ch04objectsandclasses/ex02/Part1Analysis.txt

Part 2.
Write a program that uses your DateComparator class and my DateComparator class. It should
compare how long it took for each method to execute. The output should look like this:


Testing DateComparator classes with dates: 01/06/100,01/06/190000

The output below is for class: com.israluci.ch04objectsandclasses.ex01.vlad.DateComparor
Method computeDaysBetweenDates was called. It ran for X minutes Y seconds Z milliseconds and returned: 69359552
Method computeMonthsBetweenDates was called. It executed for X minutes Y seconds Z milliseconds and returned: 2278800
Method computeYearsBetweenDates was called. It executed for X minutes Y seconds Z milliseconds and returned: 189900

The output below is for class: com.israluci.ch04objectsandclasses.ex01.DateComparor
Method computeDaysBetweenDates was called. It ran for X minutes Y seconds Z milliseconds and returned: 69359552
Method computeMonthsBetweenDates was called. It executed for X minutes Y seconds Z milliseconds and returned: 2278800
Method computeYearsBetweenDates was called. It executed for X minutes Y seconds Z milliseconds and returned: 189900

Bye!


Put your code solution in a package named com.israluci.ch04objectsandclasses.ex02 and then answer the question in
com/israluci/ch04objectsandclasses/ex02/Part2Analysis.txt

Now you have access to commit to git so please commit the code in repository https://github.com/sbookert/israluci

Enjoy!
