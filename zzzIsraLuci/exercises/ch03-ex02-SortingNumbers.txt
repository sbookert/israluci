Exercise specification:
********************************************************************************************



Write a program that produces the following command line prompt and operations:



Hello, insert some numbers separated by commas:
2,6,7,3,1

Thanks! 

Here is are your numbers in ascending order:
1,2,3,6,7

Here is are your numbers in descending order:
7,6,3,2,1



Put your solution in a package named com.israluci.ch03fundamentalstructures.ex02 and skype me 
the file or files when you are done.

This is a little bit harder than your last exercise, and it will get harder and harder. Good luck!



Feedback 1:
********************************************************************************************

First of all I really like your solution. However you need to find a different strategy for reading in the 
input so that it doesn't generate unexpected results.

Here is 1 output:
Hello, insert some numbers separated by commas:
2,3,5
Thanks!
Here is are your numbers in ascending order:
0,0,2,3,5,
Here is are your numbers in descending order:
5,3,2,0,0,

Here is another output:
Hello, insert some numbers separated by commas:
1,4,7,8,5,2,6
Thanks!
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
	at com.israluci.ch03fundamentalstructures.ex02.OrderNumbers.main(OrderNumbers.java:25)
	
Can you fix the program so you don't have extra zeros in the first program and you don't get an exception when entering 
more than 5 numbers? If you'd like me to give you a hint let me know.

Please name your new solution OrderNumbers02.java

HINT 1:
first read the input as one string, then break it up into pieces using the split method like this: "1,9,4".split(",");
then convert to int then do the sorting.

Feedback 2:
********************************************************************************************

This solution is very nice! I really like the way you used comments. It's very useful and important when you write code.

Going forward I'd like you become more detail oriented. This is important because most of the time programmers 
make errors because they aren't paying attention and they forget something that they had thought of. What this 
means for you is that you should make the output exactly as the exercise asks. 

For example:
- If there are spaces between lines make sure to add them in your solution. 
- If there is a comma at the end of the list in your solution but not in the instructions make sure to remove it.
