Answer this question:
Why is there a difference in run times between the two classes?

Put your answer here:
I implemented computeDaysBetweenDates method and computeMonthsBetweenDates method using loops. The loops make my program really slow and hard to understand its logic.
While you implemented the methods using calculations. The calculations make your program run really fast. When testing your class it took from 0 to 1 milliseconds to run
while my program took from 10 seconds to 1 minute to run. This really makes think about choosing my solutions carefully.
